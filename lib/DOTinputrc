# Because the cursor "backs up" one place when you enter command mode,
# you'll be completing on different (one character shorter) prefix than
# if you just hit up arrow in insert mode.  So if you're looking for the
# last grep command and type "grESCk", the cursor is on the 'r' and bash
# is only looking for previous commands *up to* (but not incl.) the 'r',
# so you'll get (e.g.) git commands in your search, too.  The workaround
# for this is to type "grSPACE ESCk".  Then you will get previous grep
# commands but not previous git commands.
