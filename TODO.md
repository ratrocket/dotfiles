My bash completion script is almost 10000 lines.  Maybe there's a more
compact solution?  (And it's doing a bunch of stuff that I didn't even
know it could do, but that I'd be happy to use if could remember.
Remember to hit tab, I guess.)

There's a path in the bash completion file that might need to be changed.
I put a multiline "TODO" by it (it's near the top of the file).
